                <p>Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known
                    for my work
                    on
                    Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
                    <br>
                    I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications beyond pure calculation, and to
                    have
                    published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.
                    <br>
                    In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, mathematics, and computational
                    mathematics. I
                    also like to take my chances of winning big.
                    <br>
                    Fun fact! I've been programing for 6,568,797,826 seconds!
                </p>
