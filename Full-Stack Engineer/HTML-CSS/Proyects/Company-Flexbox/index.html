      <h2>Thesis of Invesment</h2>
      <p>We’re obsessed with investing.
        Investing in projects.
        Investing in people.

        But more than anything, change the ways in which
        Founders in CAPUC connect with Venture Capitalists.

        We’re entrepreneurs that once walked in your shoes
        and we agree: raising a seed round in this region has to stop being so difficult.

        That’s why this VC was born.

        To invert the CAPUC VC logic for once and for all.
        To invert the ways in which a VC can create a virtuous community
        regardless of whether it ended up investing or passing on a startup.
        To invert the ways in which we add value while remaining available when needed,
        being always brutally honest, walking side by side you, respecting your time in each interaction.

        Helping the South American Founders is a huge privilege to us.
        And our way of saying thank you is by inverting everything that has to be inverted.

        Hello CAPUC. A pleasure to meet you.
        See you very soon.</p>
