      <h2>Thesis of Invesment</h2>
      <p>We’re obsessed with investing.<br>Investing in projects.<br>Investing in people.</p>
      <p>
        But more than anything, change the ways in which<br>
        Founders in CAPUC connect with Venture Capitalists.
      </p>

      <p>We’re entrepreneurs that once walked in your shoes<br>
        and we agree: raising a seed round in this region has to stop being so difficult.
      </p>

      <p>That’s why we were born.</p>
      <p>
        To invert the CAPUC VC logic for once and for all.<br>
        To invert the ways in which a VC can create a virtuous community<br>
        regardless of whether it ended up investing or passing on a startup.<br>
        To invert the ways in which we add value while remaining available when needed,<br>
        being always brutally honest, walking side by side you, respecting your time in each interaction.</p>

      <p>Helping the South American Founders is a huge privilege to us.<br>
        our way of saying thank you is by inverting everything that has to be inverted.</p>

      <p>Hello CAPUC. A pleasure to meet you.<br>
        See you very soon.</p>
