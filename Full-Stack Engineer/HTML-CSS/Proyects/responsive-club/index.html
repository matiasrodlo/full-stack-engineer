                    <p>Books are incredible. There’s simply no other way to learn and retain information from a
                        compendium
                        of
                        specialized human
                        knowledge. Authors living or dead - all of them have invaluable wisdom to impart -- which is why
                        I
                        read
                        a book a day,
                        and you should too. <br> <br>

                        “But Tai” I can hear you saying, “How do you manage to not just read a book a day, but retain
                        the
                        lessons it teaches
                        you?” I go into great detail on this idea in my Smart Reading course, but in this post, I’m
                        going to
                        give you a few
                        nuggets of insight that will show you how to read smarter -- not faster. <br> <br>

                        There are more than 7 billion people on this planet. In two books I read recently, Riveted and
                        Where
                        Good Ideas Come
                        From, the complexity of our world and the pace of learning is growing so exponentially that one
                        of
                        the
                        greatest skills
                        you can have is to get through new material quickly and remember it.</p>
